# html_css-introduction
Introduction to html and css by creating a one-page website.

This project is a simple one-page website of a fictitious company named The Human Earth Society for Humans. The webpage lists some information about the company as well as an option to sign up for their newsletter.

I used VSCode to create the website and Figma to create the images. The biggest challenge was to try to position things so that they looked nice. I enjoyed this assignment and learned new things such as how to use images as a link and using the float property as well as getting more familiar with setting up html and css in a more readable format.
